can you create a script for testing manually ? create 4 articles and a username called Muthu
```

**Specific Requirements:**
- Create manual testing script
- Username must be "Muthu"
- Create exactly 4 articles
- Script should facilitate testing of content moderation features

**Deliverable:** `test_content_moderation.sh` script that:
